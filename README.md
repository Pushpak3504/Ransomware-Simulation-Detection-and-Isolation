# Ransomware Attack Simulation & Blue Team Defense
## A Controlled Metasploitable2 Security Lab

## Introduction

Ransomware attacks rarely fail because of a single vulnerability.
They succeed due to weak visibility, poor segmentation, and delayed response.

This project demonstrates a full attack-to-defense lifecycle inside a
controlled laboratory environment, starting from initial network exposure
and ending with automated detection and containment.

Rather than focusing on exploitation alone, the core objective is to
