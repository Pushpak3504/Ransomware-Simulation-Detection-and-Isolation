# Metasploitable2 Ransomware Detection & Blue Team Defense Lab

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a **controlled penetration testing lab** followed by **blue team hardening and ransomware detection**, performed on **Metasploitable2** in an isolated environment.

The goal is to:
- Understand common attack vectors (for learning purposes)
- Simulate ransomware behavior in a lab
- Design and implement **defensive controls** using CIS-aligned practices

⚠️ **This repository is strictly for educational and defensive security research.**
