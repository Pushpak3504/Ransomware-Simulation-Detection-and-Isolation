🛡️ Ransomware Attack Simulation & Blue Team Defense
A Controlled Metasploitable2 Security Lab
📖 Introduction

Ransomware attacks rarely fail because of a single vulnerability — they succeed due to weak visibility, poor segmentation, and delayed response.

This project demonstrates a full attack-to-defense lifecycle inside a controlled laboratory environment, starting from initial network exposure and ending with automated detection and containment.

Rather than focusing on exploitation alone, the core objective is to design, validate, and showcase blue team controls that:

Detect ransomware-like behavior

Automatically isolate compromised systems

Enforce CIS-aligned hardening on legacy Linux hosts

🎯 Project Objectives

Simulate a realistic ransomware attack safely in a lab

Understand how attackers progress through a vulnerable system

Build real-time defensive mechanisms using native Linux tools

Validate security controls through practical testing
